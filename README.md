## Test your skills in the stock market

This is a flask app that allows users to sign and trade fake stocks on the stock market. The user can look up, buy, sell, and add money to their balance.
Unfortantly, an api from IEX is required to run this, and my free subscription has expired. This is simply to show off the code.
To see the program working, check out my youtube video [here](https://youtu.be/mXC-JECjWfM)
